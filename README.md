The `proxy-server` microservice acts as the main entry point for client requests, routing them to the appropriate microservices.

### 4. Registry

The `registry` microservice maintains service discovery and registry, facilitating seamless communication between microservices.

### 5. Mail Service

The `mail` microservice handles email notifications, providing functionalities such as sending confirmation emails and notifications to users.

### 6. Newsletter Service

The `newsletter` microservice manages the creation and distribution of newsletters, enhancing user engagement.
